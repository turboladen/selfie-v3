# Selfie Package Manager Implementation Blueprint

## Overview

The Selfie package manager will be built following a hexagonal architecture pattern, organizing code
into clear layers that separate core business logic from external concerns. This approach allows us
to build and test components independently while maintaining clear boundaries between different
parts of the system.

## Phase 1: Core Domain Models

The foundation of the system begins with the core domain models that represent the fundamental
concepts of our package manager. These models define the shape of our data and the rules that govern
it.

### Package Definition Model

We begin by implementing the basic structure that represents a package in our system. This includes:

- Package metadata (name, version, description)
- Environment configurations
- Installation commands
- Basic validation rules

### Configuration Model

The configuration model defines how the system itself is configured, including:

- Environment settings
- Directory locations
- System-wide preferences
- Validation rules for configuration

### Environment Model

This model handles how different environments are represented and managed:

- Environment identification
- Environment-specific settings
- Compatibility checking
- Environment validation rules

### Package Validation

Building on the package model, we implement comprehensive validation:

- Required field validation
- Format validation
- Cross-field validation
- Environment compatibility validation

### Dependency Graph

The dependency resolution system includes:

- Graph data structure
- Dependency relationship tracking
- Cycle detection
- Installation order determination

## Phase 2: Core Business Logic

With our domain models in place, we implement the core business logic that operates on these models.

### Package Resolution

The system that finds and validates packages:

- Package lookup
- Version resolution
- Environment matching
- Dependency collection

### Installation Management

The core installation process handling:

- Installation scheduling
- Status tracking
- Command execution
- Error handling

### Command Execution

The system for running installation commands:

- Command preparation
- Execution management
- Output capture
- Error handling

### Installation Status

Tracking and managing installation state:

- Progress tracking
- State management
- Error tracking
- Results recording

### Progress Reporting

The system for reporting installation progress:

- Status updates
- Progress calculation
- Time tracking
- User feedback

## Phase 3: Adapters

The adapters layer connects our core business logic to external systems and services.

### File System Operations

Handles all file system interactions:

- File reading/writing
- Directory management
- Path resolution
- Permission handling

### YAML Parsing

Manages configuration and package file parsing:

- YAML reading
- Schema validation
- Error handling
- Data transformation

### Shell Command Execution

Handles executing commands on the system:

- Process management
- Output capture
- Error handling
- Resource cleanup

### Terminal Output

Manages user interface output:

- Progress display
- Status updates
- Error messages
- Color handling

### Logging

Implements system logging:

- Log writing
- Rotation
- Level filtering
- Format management

## Phase 4: User Interface

The outer layer that interacts directly with users.

### Command Line Parsing

Handles user input through the command line:

- Argument parsing
- Option handling
- Command routing
- Help text generation

### Terminal UI

Implements the interactive terminal interface:

- Progress bars
- Status display
- Color output
- Interactive elements

### Progress Bars

Manages installation progress display:

- Progress calculation
- Visual feedback
- Time estimation
- Status updates

### Error Reporting

Handles user-facing error presentation:

- Error formatting
- Context presentation
- Solution suggestions
- Recovery guidance

## Implementation Strategy

Each phase builds upon the previous ones, with clear boundaries between layers. The implementation
follows these principles:

1. Start with core models and work outward
2. Maintain clear separation between layers
3. Test components independently
4. Integrate gradually and verify
5. Document as we build
6. Maintain consistent error handling
7. Focus on user experience

This blueprint provides a structured approach to building the Selfie package manager, ensuring that
each component is well-defined, tested, and integrated properly into the larger system.
