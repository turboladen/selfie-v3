# Detailed Implementation Steps

## Step 1: Package Definition Foundation

Implement the core PackageNode structure and basic validation logic. Start with just these fields:

- name: String
- version: String
- environments: HashMap<String, EnvironmentConfig>

Create EnvironmentConfig with:

- install: String

Write tests that:

1. Create a PackageNode from raw fields
2. Validate required fields are present
3. Validate fields are not empty strings

Do not implement YAML parsing yet - just the core structure and validation.

The code should follow:

1. Define the structures
2. Implement basic validation
3. Write unit tests
4. Add builder pattern for testing

Reference the package definition format from the specification but implement only these basic fields
for now.

## Step 2: Basic Configuration Model

Building on the previous step, implement the core Config structure with:

- environment: String
- package_directory: PathBuf

Include:

1. Basic validation (required fields, non-empty)
2. Path expansion for package_directory
3. Unit tests for validation and path handling
4. Error types for configuration issues

Do not implement YAML parsing or file loading yet - focus on the core model and validation logic.

This should integrate with the PackageNode from Step 1 by using the same validation patterns and
error handling approach.

## Step 3: Environment Resolution

Using the structures from steps 1 and 2, implement environment resolution logic:

1. Add environment validation to PackageNode
2. Implement resolution between Config environment and PackageNode environments
3. Create appropriate error types for environment mismatches
4. Add tests for:
